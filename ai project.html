HI GUYS <br>I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by
 <b> SHAPEAI</b> <br>
The instructor during the session was <B>Mr. Shaurya Sinha</B> (Data Analyst Intern at Jio).<br><img src="shape ai sir.jpeg" width="315px" height="235px"> <br>I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>HTML
<li>CSS
<br>During these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
<BR>I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well.
